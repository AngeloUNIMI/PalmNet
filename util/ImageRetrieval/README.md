ImageRetrieval
==============

Content Based Image Retrieval Techniques (e.g. knn, svm using MatLab GUI).

When cloning the repository you'll have to create a directory inside it and name it images.

Inside the images directory you're gonna put your own images which in a sense actually forms your image dataset.

Then you're gonna have to build the features dataset by pressing the red button with the label "Create DB of image features"

If you don't have any images you can use the wang dataset which is the one I used to demonstrate the above techniques.

You can download it from here: http://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/related/
